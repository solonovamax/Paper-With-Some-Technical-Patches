# Technical-Paper
## What is this project?
Technical-Paper is a fork of paper which is designed to be nicer to use for technical players.

It mainly focuses on reverting changes that paper has made to minecraft
(such as patching falling entity dupes), instead of adding features of its own.

## I want xxx thing added
If there is something that you think should be changed, please feel free to open an issue.
I'll get around to it when I have time.
